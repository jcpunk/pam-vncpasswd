== Name

pam_fnal_vncpasswd - PAM module for VNC password file authentication

== Synopsis

----
auth required pam_fnal_vncpasswd.so [file=PATH] [nullok]
----

== Description

*pam_fnal_vncpasswd* authenticates users against a per-user VNC-specific
password file.  The password file stores a single crypt(3) hash (SHA-512,
yescrypt, or another method configured in *login.defs*(5)).

The default password file location is *~/.config/vnc/fnal_vncpasswd*.
This follows the XDG configuration directory convention.  The password is
set using *fnal-vncpasswd*(1).

This module is designed for environments where normal system authentication
is not available for VNC sessions — for example, group accounts that
authenticate via Kerberos (no local password) but need a separate VNC
password for Weston + NeatVNC sessions on RHEL 10.

=== Password file format

The file contains a single crypt(3) hash string, for example:

 $y$j9T$saltbytes$hashbytes    (yescrypt, RHEL 10 default)
 $6$rounds=65536$salt$hash     (SHA-512)
 $5$rounds=65536$salt$hash     (SHA-256)

The file must:

* be owned by the authenticating user
* have permissions 0600 or stricter (no group or world read/write)
* be a regular file (not a symlink)

=== Security design

* *O_NOFOLLOW* is used when opening the password file to prevent symlink
  attacks (TOCTOU protection).
* After open, *fstat*(2) verifies ownership and permissions.
* Password comparison uses a constant-time XOR accumulator to prevent
  timing side-channel leakage.
* The plaintext password is locked in RAM with *mlock*(2) to prevent it
  being swapped to disk.
* All sensitive buffers are cleared with *explicit_bzero*(3) before returning.

=== Password length

The VNC protocol (RFB) limits VNC Authentication passwords to 8 characters.
*fnal-vncpasswd*(1) enforces this limit at password-set time.

The PAM module does *not* enforce a length limit.  A password longer than
8 characters is treated the same as any other wrong password — crypt(3)
produces a hash that does not match the stored value, and the module returns
*PAM_AUTH_ERR*.  This is intentional: the module should not leak information
about *why* authentication failed.

=== Yescrypt support

yescrypt is the default *ENCRYPT_METHOD* on RHEL 10 and modern Fedora.
Unlike SHA-crypt methods, yescrypt's cost is encoded by *crypt_gensalt_ra*(3)
as a parameter string (e.g. _j9T_ for cost factor 5) rather than a
`rounds=N` prefix.  The *YESCRYPT_COST_FACTOR* directive in *login.defs*(5)
controls the cost; the default is 5.

== Module types provided

*auth*, *account*, *session*, *password*

== Return values

PAM_SUCCESS::
    Authentication succeeded.

PAM_AUTH_ERR::
    Password is wrong, file has incorrect permissions, or another
    authentication error occurred.

PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL::
    Password file does not exist and *nullok* was not specified.

PAM_USER_UNKNOWN::
    The user does not exist in the system password database.

== Options

*file=*_PATH_::
    Use _PATH_ as the password file instead of the default
    (~/.config/vnc/fnal_vncpasswd).  Useful for testing or non-standard
    configurations.

*nullok*::
    If the password file does not exist, return *PAM_SUCCESS* instead of
    *PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL*.  Allows VNC login before a VNC password is set.

== Examples

=== Basic configuration

----
# /etc/pam.d/vncserver
auth    required    pam_fnal_vncpasswd.so
auth    required    pam_deny.so
account required    pam_permit.so
session required    pam_permit.so
----

=== Allow login even without a VNC password set

----
auth    sufficient  pam_fnal_vncpasswd.so nullok
auth    required    pam_unix.so
----

=== Custom password file location

----
auth    required    pam_fnal_vncpasswd.so file=/etc/vnc/shared_passwd
----

== Files

*~/.config/vnc/fnal_vncpasswd*::
    Default per-user VNC password file.

*/etc/login.defs*::
    Read for *ENCRYPT_METHOD*, *YESCRYPT_COST_FACTOR*, and
    *SHA_CRYPT_MAX_ROUNDS*.
